File Structure:
/src: Contains all the TypeScript source code. It's good to separate the source code from configuration files and node_modules.

/src/config: Contains configuration files, such as the MongoDB connection setup.

/src/controllers: Contains all controller files, where each controller corresponds to a model and contains functions to handle HTTP requests.

/src/models: Contains all Mongoose model definitions.

/src/routes: Contains all route definitions, where each route file corresponds to a model/controller.

/src/services: Contains all the business logic of your application. Each service corresponds to a model and is used by the corresponding controller.

/src/utils: Contains utility functions and constants that can be used throughout the application.

/src/app.ts: This is the entry point for your application. It is responsible for setting up your Express application, middleware, and routes.

/tests: Contains all your test files.

.env: A file for environment variables, such as the MongoDB connection string.

package.json: Lists the package dependencies for the project.
