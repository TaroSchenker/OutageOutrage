    Project Architecture Document

1. Overview

The project is a simulation game built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The game simulates a software project with varying business impacts where the player needs to manage a budget, morale, staff, tasks, and events over a specific time period.

2. Project Structure

```
├── src
│   ├── config
│   ├── controllers
│   ├── models
│   ├── routes
│   ├── services
│   ├── utils
│   └── app.ts
├── tests
├── node_modules
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```

```
/src: Contains all the TypeScript source code. It's good to separate the source code from configuration files and node_modules.
/src/config: Contains configuration files, such as the MongoDB connection setup.
/src/controllers: Contains all controller files, where each controller corresponds to a model and contains functions to handle HTTP requests.
/src/models: Contains all Mongoose model definitions.
/src/routes: Contains all route definitions, where each route file corresponds to a model/controller.
/src/services: Contains all the business logic of your application. Each service corresponds to a model and is used by the corresponding controller.
/src/utils: Contains utility functions and constants that can be used throughout the application.
/src/app.ts: This is the entry point for your application. It is responsible for setting up your Express application, middleware, and routes.
/tests: Contains all your test files.
.env: A file for environment variables, such as the MongoDB connection string.
package.json: Lists the package dependencies for the project.
tsconfig.json: Configuration for the TypeScript compiler.
```

3. Design Principles

    Code Organization
Modularity: The codebase is split into modules based on functionality (like tasks, staff, game events, etc.) to keep things organized and maintain separation of concerns.
Layered architecture: The application follows a layered architecture model, separating concerns into models (for data handling), routes (for routing), controllers (for HTTP request handling), services (for business logic), and configurations.
Naming Conventions
Use camelCase for variable and function names, and PascalCase for interfaces and classes.
Use UPPER_CASE for constants and enum values.
Data Modeling
MongoDB is used for the database, with Mongoose as an ODM. Each document type has a corresponding Mongoose model.
ObjectId references are used to link related documents.
Error Handling
A middleware function, errorHandler, is used for centralized error handling.
All errors are passed to this middleware for consistent error response structure.
Authentication and Authorization
Currently, the application does not include any authentication or authorization logic. If this is required, consider using libraries like Passport.js or jsonwebtoken.
Environment Variables
Sensitive data such as database URLs and secret keys should be stored in environment variables and accessed through process.env.
Testing
Currently, there are no testing suites included. For future improvement, consider implementing unit tests using libraries like Jest, and end-to-end tests with Supertest.
Documentation
Code comments should be used to explain complex code logic. Docstrings should be added to functions to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values.
A README file should be included to explain how to set up and run the application.
API Design
The API follows RESTful principles, with endpoints corresponding to resources (like /api/tasks, /api/gameEvents, etc.).
HTTP verbs are used to represent operations on these resources.
Responses should include appropriate HTTP status codes.
