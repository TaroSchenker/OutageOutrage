Create a Feature Branch: You develop your new features or bug fixes in a separate branch created from the main (or sometimes called the "master") branch.

Push the Feature Branch: You push this branch to the remote repository.

Create a Pull Request (PR): You create a pull request to merge the feature branch into a common development or staging branch.

CI/CD Pipeline: When you push your branch or create a pull request, the CI/CD pipeline (defined in your YAML file) can be triggered to build, test, and maybe even deploy to a staging environment.

Merge to Staging Branch: After successful checks, you might merge the PR into a staging branch and deploy to a staging environment for further testing.

Merge to Main Branch: Finally, once everything has been validated in the staging environment, you merge into the main branch, which could trigger a deployment to production.
